# Week-3_EV_Chatbot
Chatbot for answering Electric Vehicle (EV) related queries using Python and rule-based logic – Week 3 Internship Task under Electric Vehicle (Gen AI) domain.
EV Chatbot – Week 3 Internship Task
Overview

This project is a simple Electric Vehicle (EV) Chatbot built using Python. The chatbot is designed to answer basic EV-related queries such as battery life, charging time, range, cost, and efficiency. It uses rule-based logic to simulate conversations and provide quick responses to user inputs.

Objective

To develop a chatbot that can interact with users and provide information related to electric vehicles, enhancing automation and user engagement through natural language communication.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Google Colab
IPyWidgets (for interactive chat UI)
Rule-based logic (for chatbot responses)

 Features

✅ Responds to common EV questions such as battery, charging, range, and cost
✅ Simple text-based conversational interface
✅ Runs interactively inside Google Colab
✅ Customizable for adding more questions and answers

 Output Example

Console Output:

EV RuleBot ready. Type 'quit' to stop.
You: battery
EVBot: Most EV batteries last between 8–10 years or around 1.5 lakh km.
You: price
EVBot: EV prices vary between ₹8 lakh – ₹20 lakh depending on model and battery.
You: quit
EVBot: Bye! ⚡

How to Run

Open the notebook 03_ev_chatbot.ipynb in Google Colab.
Run all cells in order.
Type your query in the chat input box or console when prompted.
Type quit or exit to stop the chatbot.

Improvisations from Previous Weeks

Week 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Week 2: Machine Learning Model Creation
Week 3: Built a functional Chatbot that interacts with users about EV details.

Conclusion

This chatbot marks a step toward AI-driven conversational interfaces in the Electric Vehicle domain. It can be expanded with machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) in future tasks for more dynamic and intelligent responses.
